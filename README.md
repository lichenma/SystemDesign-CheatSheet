# System Design - CheatSheet

A compilation of notes that I made when learning these programming topics online - Note a majority of the content and code was taken off of 
online websites so I do not take any ownership of the below. The following is simply notes compiled for learning purposes.


## Getting Started

Currently SystemDesign-CheatSheet contains various text files for notes but is primarily composed of this `README.md` file which supports the markdown formatting language. This makes the notes and code look a lot better and supports many awesome features like quick links 
and makes formatting much easier. 


### Prerequisites

In the future I might add a html document which also performs some formatting and if that comes out, ideally the html and css
would be written for web browsers on large screens which support the newest version of bootstrap and html 5.
I use the following application when building and testing html.

```
Chrome Version 71.0.3578.98
```

# Design Patterns 

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in the codebase. 

Patterns are not specific pieces of code, but rather a general concept for solving a particular problem - they are often confused with algorithms because both describe typical solutions to some known problems. 

- Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if we never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful becuase it teaches how to solve problems using the principles of object-oriented design.
